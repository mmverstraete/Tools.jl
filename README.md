Welcome to [Tools](https://github.com/mmverstraete/Tools), a Julia language package that offers generic tools to manipulate MISR and MISRHR variables and data files. This package depends in part, and largely expands on, the functionality provided by the Some of those functions may rely on the [JMtk15](https://github.com/mmverstraete/) package.

This package supersedes the `JMTools` package initially published in early 2023 and includes additional functions, minor bug fixes and updates in the documentation. However, these functions implement concepts and codes originally developed since 2005 in the IDL language. These older codes are also available from this GitHub web site, but are not maintained any more: all new developments and efforts are now focused on the Julia implementation of these codes.
