    bool = is_valid_misr_camera(misr_camera)

# Purpose(s):
* Determine whether the specified `misr_camera` is a valid MISR camera name.

# Positional argument(s):
* `misr_camera::AbstractString`: The MISR camera name.

# Keyword argument(s): None.

# Return value(s):
* `bool::Bool`: Whether `misr_camera` is valid or not.

# Algorithm:
* This function checks that the value of the positional argument `misr_camera` is valid.

# Reference(s):
* The MISRHR Processing System Manual.

# Note(s):
* MISR Camera names are composed of two letters, both in upper case, where the first letter refers to the bore angle, while the second is either `F` for the forward-pointing cameras, `N` for the nadir-pointing camera, or `A` for the aft-pointing cameras.
* In some contexts, the MISR Camera field can be specified as "*" to represent the set of 9 similar files, one for each of the 9 cameras, but in that case the eventual presence of this specification must be detected before evaluating the validity of the camera name.

# Example 1:
```julia
julia> using Tools

julia> bool = is_valid_misr_camera("AA")
true
```

# Example 2:
```julia
julia> using Tools

julia> bool = is_valid_misr_camera("df")
false
```
